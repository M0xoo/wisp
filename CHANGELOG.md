# Changelog

All notable changes to `wisp-agents` are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- A follow-up sent while an agent is working now goes out right away: wisp interrupts the run and resumes the session with your message. To get the old behaviour back (wait until the run finishes), turn on the **Queue** toggle next to the send button. It shows while the agent is working, and wisp remembers the choice.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-10-16

### Fixed

- Desktop app: sending a message no longer opens an extra wisp icon in the Dock. The `ask_user` helper now runs the Electron binary as plain Node (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`) instead of starting a second app.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- Desktop app: native right-click menu with spelling suggestions, Copy Link, undo/redo, cut/copy/paste and select all. Inspect Element appears only in dev mode.

### Fixed

- macOS: the Dock shows "wisp" with the wisp icon instead of "Electron". The app now launches from a renamed clone of `Electron.app`, cached per Electron version under `~/Library/Caches/wisp`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- `npx wisp-agents` opens the desktop app. Electron is now an optional dependency that is fetched on first launch. The CLI starts the app detached and falls back to the browser when Electron isn't available.
- `--browser` flag to keep the browser-only behaviour.

### Fixed

- Parsing of the `wisp` fence is more robust: malformed blocks are salvaged instead of dropped, and the raw turn text is kept.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- First public release on npm as `wisp-agents`, with `wisp` and `wisp-agents` bins and a `--version` / `-v` flag.
- Launch Claude Code agents in the background and read the presentation they hand back: diffs, tests, commits, flows and questions.
- Session queue with follow-ups, answers to agent questions, terminal takeover and mark-as-done.
- Older turns are folded, with a floating collapse-all button and back-to-top.
